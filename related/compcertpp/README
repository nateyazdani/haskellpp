WARNING: compiling proofs may take more than 2 hours. To compile
proofs, type: make proof

To compile HTML documentation, type: make doc

The best result is given if each $file.v theory comes with its
companion $file.glob (which should be present in the original
archive), but if absent (or outdated), compilation does not fail:
instead, $file.html will contain no link (or incorrect links) to other
theories.

You can compile the proof $theory.vo for one given theory $theory.v,
to do so type: make $theory.vo
In that case, the corresponding $theory.glob will be regenerated.

Each $file.src describes a theory package. You can build an archive by
typing: make $file.tar
or: make $file.tgz
or: make $file.tbz2
The built package contains all relevant *.v theories, along with their
*.glob files needed to build the documentation, if any.
