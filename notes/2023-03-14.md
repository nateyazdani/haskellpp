# Research meeting: 03/14

## Minutes
- Overall vision: Don’t expect to achieve zero glue code — better strategy is to assume wrappers on each side then analyze where glue code is semantically unnecessary
	- _e.g._, use pattern synonyms to present ADT interface for pointer wrapper instead of compiler modification

## Follow up
1. **Work out an example between actual C++ and Haskell by empirical observation**
	1. Just how little glue code do you need for a “nice” example? 
		1. Try out structs and records
		2. Next variants
2. Attempt a Clight interpreter in the style of miniHaskell
	1. Throw out goto, break, continue
	2. Model any remaining nonlocal control flow as continuations
3. Work out an example between miniHaskell and Clight
4. Hypothesize a layout calculus between STG and s++
