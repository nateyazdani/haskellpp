# Research meeting: 03/14

## Minutes
* Overall vision: Don’t expect to achieve zero glue code —- better strategy is to assume wrappers on each side then analyze where glue code is semantically unnecessary
    + For example, use pattern synonyms to present ADT interface for pointer wrapper instead of compiler modification.

## Follow up
1. **Work out an example between actual C++ and Haskell by empirical observation**
    * Just how little glue code do you need for a “nice” example? 
        + Try out structs and records
        + Next variants
2. Attempt a Clight interpreter in the style of miniHaskell
    * Throw out goto, break, continue
    * Model any remaining nonlocal control flow as continuations
3. Work out an example between miniHaskell and Clight
4. Hypothesize a layout calculus between STG and s++
