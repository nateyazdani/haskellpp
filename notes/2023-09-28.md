# Research meeting: 09/14

## Status
* System FC (i.e., the underlying calculus for Core Haskell) is easily a sufficient model of Haskell for our purposes.
* For C++, the κ++ calculus seems the clear choice.
  * s++ and Ds++ omit object initialization (i.e., construction and destruction)
  * CoreC++, mentioned in [prior work by Frank Tip](refs/cpp.core.pdf), omits object structure (i.e., fields)
* Interestingly, the C++ ABI is standardized as the ironically named [Itanium C++ ABI](https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html), but I don't see much utility for this low-level standard.
* As a next step, I want to implement System FC and κ++ as interpreters or simple translators into a machine model.
    * What machine model do we want? Probably some sort of CBPV calculcus?

## Minutes
* 

## Follow up
1. Implement a model of Haskell-C++ interoperation in terms of plzoo-style interpreters and compilers.
