# Research meeting: 09/28

## Status
* System FC (i.e., the underlying calculus for Core Haskell) is easily a sufficient model of Haskell for our purposes.
* For C++, the κ++ calculus seems the clear choice.
    * s++ and Ds++ omit object initialization (i.e., construction and destruction)
    * CoreC++, developed in [prior work by Frank Tip](refs/cpp.core.pdf), omits object structure (i.e., fields)
* Interestingly, the C++ ABI is standardized as the ironically named [Itanium C++ ABI](https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html), but I don't see much utility for this low-level standard.
* As a next step, I want to implement System FC and κ++ as interpreters or simple translators into a machine model.
    * What machine model do we want? Probably some sort of CBPV calculcus?

## Minutes
* Amal and I looked at the Itanium C++ ABI and feel confident that it's much too low level for our purposes
    * We even looked at the SysV ABI and found it even more low level (e.g., binary object format) and largely inapplicable to our ends
* Want an appropriate CBPV as our machine model
    * From [Lucy's notes](refs/cbpv.lucy.pdf), HA-CBPV looks closest
    * LL-CBPV is not low level in the ways needed for our aims
    * We should integrate necessary aspects of the [CompCert memory model](refs/compcert.memory.pdf)
        * V1 should suffice

## Follow up
1. Extend HA-CBPV with the CompCert memory model
2. Compile CC-CBPV to HA-CBPV with said extension
3. Implement a model of κ++ as a compiler into HA-CBPV with said extension
    * Don't skip the first two tasks for this -- unlikely to finish by next week
    * My current aim is just to develop a more cohesive understanding of κ++ through this exercise

## Addendum
* Caught up with Theo in our one-on-one meeting the following Monday (2023-10-02)
* Theo suggested two objective-oriented readings to focus our attention and priorities:
    1. Summarize the proof obligations for the [realizability semantics of interoperability](refs/interop.sound.pdf)
        * Refer also to [Daniel's dissertation](refs/interop.realiz.pdf)
        * Might fall through to next week
    2. Summarize the [call-by-push-value model of the LLVM machine model](refs/cbpv.ssa.pdf)
        * Refer also to [the later ArXiv paper](refs/cbpv.cfg.pdf)
        * Might fall through to next week
